## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version control - also known as source control or revision control, it is an important software development practice for tracking and managing changes made to code and other files. It is closely related to source code management.
Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps in recording changes made to files by keeping a track of modifications done in the code. 

Benefits of the version control system:
Enhances the project development speed by providing efficient collaboration
Leverages the productivity, expedites product delivery, and skills of the employees through better communication and assistance
Reduce possibilities of errors and conflicts meanwhile project development through traceability to every small change
Employees or contributors of the project can contribute from anywhere irrespective of the different geographical locations through this VCS
For each different contributor to the project, a different working copy is maintained and not merged to the main file unless the working copy is validated. The most popular example is Git, Helix core, Microsoft TFS.
Helps in recovery in case of any disaster or contingent situation,
Informs us about Who, What, When, Why changes have been made.

Types of Version Control Systems: 
I. Local Version Control Systems
II. Centralized Version Control Systems
III. Distributed Version Control Systems
Local Version Control Systems: It is one of the simplest forms and has a database that kept all the changes to files under revision control. RCS is one of the most common VCS tools. It keeps patch sets (differences between files) in a special format on disk. By adding up all the patches it can then re-create what any file looked like at any point in time. 
Centralized Version Control Systems: Centralized version control systems contain just one repository globally and every user need to commit for reflecting one’s changes in the repository. It is possible for others to see your changes by updating. 

Distributed Version Control Systems: Distributed version control systems contain multiple repositories. Each user has their own repository and working copy. Just committing your changes will not give others access to your changes. This is because commit will reflect those changes in your local repository and you need to push them in order to make them visible on the central repository. Similarly, When you update, you do not get others’ changes unless you have first pulled those changes into your repository. 

Why Git
Git is an open source distributed version control system that helps software teams create projects of all sizes with efficiency, speed, and asynchronicity.
Git is an open source distributed system that is used for software projects of any size, making it a popular option for startups, enterprise, and everything in between.
Git has three file states: modified, staged, and committed
A modified file has been changed but isn't committed to the database yet
A staged file is set to go into the next commit.
 When a file is committed, the data has been stored in the database.
Git is 
Reliable
Fast
Has work flow flexibility

How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
It identifies the problem areas so that team members can quickly revert changes to a previous version, compare changes, or identify who committed the problem.

It allows multiple team members to work on different parts of the code simultaneously, merge their changes, and resolve conflicts efficiently.
